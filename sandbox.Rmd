# This file is a sandbox. It should contain explorations with the dataset, along with useful comments for each exploration.

# It is important that each sanbox section should be documented of its purpose and methods, and should not spam the whole document (use filter, head, tail, etc.).

# The dataset of info on colleges listed
(college_ds = read.csv("data/project_data.csv"))

# Creating blocks with include=FALSE can make space to leave comments per section, like this one.
```

```{r, visualize college_ds}
# See the dataset of the best and worst 10 rankings of colleges
head(college_ds, 10)
tail(college_ds, 10)

# Plot the dataset of median SAT and median ACT per college into the reported early career earnings in that college.
# SAT score has a much higher range than ACT, so the graph looks more "continuous"
plot(college_ds$Median.SAT, college_ds$Early.career.earnings)
# ACT score has less range, so the graph looks "discrete"
plot(college_ds$Median.ACT, college_ds$Early.career.earnings)
